I try to be as active as I can in the Elm community through [open source contribution](https://github.com/lukewestby), [community engagement](https://meetup.com/chicago-elm), and writing. Are you new to Elm and have questions about the language? Submit your topic [here](http://goo.gl/forms/u7QcFUuxsc) or bug me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/luke_dot_js)."
